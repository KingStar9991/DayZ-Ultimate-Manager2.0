DayZ Ultimate Manager SPA frontend bundle
Place the 'index.html' into frontend/public/ and keep the assets folder alongside it.
Start your Electron app and it will load this SPA.

Pages available: dashboard, server, mods, logs, economy, trader, mapgroups, settings

This bundle is frontend-only. Backend endpoints (API) are stubs and must be wired to provide real data.
