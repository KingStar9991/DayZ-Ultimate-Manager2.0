# DayZ Ultimate Manager 2.0 (Full skeleton)

Place project at: C:\DayZ-Ultimate-Manager2.0\

Install:
  npm install

Run:
  npm run dev

Notes:
- Many features are implemented as stubs with TODO markers (steamcmd, rcon, server spawn).
- Edit environment variables or files to set real paths (STEAMCMD_PATH, WORKSHOP_PATH).
- If Electron fails to start, ensure node and npm are installed and electron is in devDependencies.
